50-days-C--Dsa
This repository tracks my 50-day coding challenge focused on C++ and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). It includes daily problem solutions, key learnings, and code implementations aimed at improving my problem-solving skills and preparing for technical interviews.

Day 4 Progress

- Functions Learned
- Function Definition: Understanding how to define and call functions in C++.
- Parameters and Arguments: Learning how to pass data to functions using parameters.
- Return Values: Using the return statement to send results back from functions.
- How function store in mememory with the help of stack and heap stack is for static and head is for dynamic
- Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference: I learned the differences between passing parameters by value (where a copy of the data is passed) and by reference (where a reference to the original data is passed). This knowledge is crucial for optimizing performance and managing memory effectively.

Write the function for :-

Sum of N Numbers : Implemented a function to calculate the sum of the first n numbers. This function takes an integer input and returns the total.

Factorial Calculation : Developed a function to compute the factorial of a given number. This function utilizes recursion to achieve the result.

nCr Program: Function to calculate the binomial coefficient (n choose r).
