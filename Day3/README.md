# C++ Patterns Program

This C++ program allows users to generate various patterns based on a user-defined integer input \( n \). The patterns include alphabetical sequences, numeric sequences, and star shapes. The program demonstrates basic concepts of loops and character handling in C++.

## Features

The program currently includes commented-out sections for different patterns, which can be activated by uncommenting the respective sections. The patterns available are:

1. **Alphabetical Pattern** (A, B, C, D, ...)
   - Outputs a square of characters, starting from 'A' and moving right for each row.

2. **Numeric Pattern** (1, 2, 3, ...)
   - Outputs a square of increasing numbers, starting from 1.

3. **Triangle Pattern with Stars**
   - Outputs a left-aligned triangle of stars:
     ```
     *
     **
     ***
     ****
     ```

4. **Triangle Pattern with Repeated Numbers**
   - Outputs a triangle where each row contains the same number repeated:
     ```
     1
     22
     333
     4444
     ```

5. **Triangle Pattern with Increasing Numbers**
   - Outputs a triangle that counts up in each row:
     ```
     1
     12
     123
     1234
     ```
